  <h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated on 02-11-2024 21:36:36</p>
  
  <p><strong>MOHAMMED UMAIR SHOAIB</strong> believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore adopted a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.</li>
    <li>MOHAMMED UMAIR SHOAIB does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not satisfactory.</li>
    <li>In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the same to our Customer Service team. The request will be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the issue. This should be reported within the same day of receipt of the products. If the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, please bring it to the notice of our customer service within the same day of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team will review your complaint and take an appropriate decision.</li>
    <li>For products with warranties from manufacturers, please direct warranty-related complaints to them.</li>
    <li>For any refunds approved by MOHAMMED UMAIR SHOAIB, it will take 1-2 days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.</li>
  </ul>
